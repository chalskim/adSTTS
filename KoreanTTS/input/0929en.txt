10 Wisdoms for Sensitive and Overthinking People to Live More Comfortably
Don’t overthink: Giving too much meaning to small things only increases anxiety. Most things fade away with time.
Don’t seek perfection: Neither people nor situations are perfect. Letting go of the burden of perfection will make your heart lighter.
Don’t waste emotions on what’s not yours: Being too affected by others’ problems or moods only exhausts you. Let go of what you cannot control.
Act instead of worrying: Worrying doesn’t improve the situation. If you can do something, act; if not, accept it.
Don’t care too much about others’ opinions: People don’t think about you as much as you think. Ultimately, it’s your life to live.
Move your body instead of thinking too much: When your mind is crowded, walking or exercising helps clear your thoughts.
Don’t try to get along with everyone: It’s impossible to maintain good relations with all. Focus on people who make you feel comfortable.
Make time to focus on yourself: Meditate quietly or enjoy hobbies to take care of yourself.
Accept life as it is: Life doesn’t always go as planned. Flowing with changes brings peace.
Don’t make all emotions your own: Learn to separate your emotions from others’.
Key point: Being sensitive is not a weakness but a strength of delicacy. However, if that delicacy burdens you, practicing to let go of unnecessary worries and lighten your heart is the way to true happiness.
