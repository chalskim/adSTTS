Eggs are a highly nutritious complete food, but as we age, it is important to wisely adjust how we consume them (quantity, cooking method, and timing).
For those over 60, it is best to wake up the stomach with warm water or soft foods before eating eggs in the morning, and to eat them slowly, preferably soft-boiled or gently cooked.
Considering cholesterol and digestion, about one egg per day is recommended, adjusted according to individual health conditions. The yolk and white can also be consumed separately depending on the situation.
Be mindful of beverages consumed with eggs (such as orange juice, green tea, or soy milk), as timing matters.
Those with digestive or chronic diseases should pay extra attention to the frequency and method of egg consumption.
From real clinical experience, it is very impressive to see how small dietary changes have brought positive effects on patientsâ€™ health.
